# Responsive Images

Designed to use a grunt file and image magic to make three sets of responsive images.
Any image files that are not to be resized should be put in the images_src/fixed directory
All other image files will be put in images_src

Update npm and node
Run npm install to update any dependecies.

New images will be found in the images directory
